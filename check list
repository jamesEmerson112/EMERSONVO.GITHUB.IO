Create a personal Web site using the UNLV Rebel Sites Student Web Publishing System.
Your site must include three HTML files and one CSS file: home.html, links.html, summary.html, and
main.css. The requirements for each file are as follows:
home.html
•x include a link tag that incorporates the external main.css stylesheet
•x include a header stating your name, class and section, and semester
•x display at least one photo (typically of yourself, but not required)
•x include some information about yourself
•x post links to the other two html files

links.html
• xinclude a link tag that incorporate the external main.css stylesheet
• xinclude a title bar and page title that indicates the purpose of the page (something like “Links”
will suffice)
•x include a list of at least 5 of your favorite links (make sure they are do not violate the OIT usage
policy)
•x include a link back to the home page

summary.html
• include a link tag that incorporates the external main.css stylesheet
• include a title bar and page title that indicates the purpose of the page (something like
“Architecture Summary”)
• include a 2-4 paragraph summary of the von Neumann computer architecture
 Source: xkcd.com/934
•x include a diagram, schematic, or image depicting the von Neumann computer architecture
◦x you may design your own or, you may use any non-copyrighted image from the web
• include a link back to the home page
main.css
• Use the main.css file to set the background. The background can either be a color you select or
an image
• Set the font to sans-serif
• Center all headers
• Feel free to experiment with other styling options as desired
The goal is to demonstrate some creativity and visual appeal for your page! For example, you should
choose contrasting font and background colors so the content is easily readable. You must create the
site and develop the HTML yourself (i.e., in a text editor) and not use any high-level tools (such as
GoogleSites, DreamWeaver, etc.).
The TA and myself will select several of the best sites and they will be shown in class.
Note, you are not allowed to use copyrighted material.
You are free to reference the W3Schools tutorials on HTML and CSS (http://www.w3schools.com/)
Prerequisites:
This assignment will require a UNLV ACE account log-in (username and password), which you should
already have.
Implementation Guidance:
Step 1:
Become familiar with a text editor. Examples include Notepad / Notepad++ (Windows), Text Wranger
(MAC), or gEdit (linux). Be able to create and edit a text file. Notepad++ is pre-installed on all UNLV
lab machines. If necessary, request assistance from the lab monitor.
Step 2:
Review the HTML Basics document, posted lecture notes, and your class notes. Ensure that you are
familiar with the following:
• Basic HTML document formatting requirements (including the html body, and head tags).
• Basic text formatting tags (including various header levels, paragraph, bold, italic) and the
associated nesting requirements. Also includes HTML tags for color, images and links.
• Internet color specifications (red, green, and blue intensities).
Step 3:
Login to any UNLV lab machine (e.g., library, TBE-A311, etc.). Use the text editor to create a basic
web page. The file should be named index.html (lower case). Unless you are already familiar with
HTML, it is suggested that you start with only the basic items outlined in the assignment guidance
(above). Note, you may create the file at home an transfer it to a lab machine when you arrive on
campus (via USB drive, or e-mail, etc.).
