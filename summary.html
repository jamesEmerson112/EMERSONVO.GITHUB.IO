			Summary:
		</h2>
		<p>
			&nbsp Von Newmann Architecture has 3 parts, e.g, memory, control unit and arithmatic and logic unit. In this architecture, memory stores both data and instructions. The control unit takes the next instrucition, and the data it needs and generally keeps an eye on where the program is. The Arithmatic and Logic unit does arithmetic and logic operations based on the instruction and the data.
			<br>
			&nbsp Because program and data are all in the same memory, any program that is put in it will work. However, it takes a tremenduous time to actually run because getting data and instruction can only be done on at a time, therefore, reading and writing process is significantly slow where as executing is very fast. This is called the Von Neumann bottleneck.
